# SQL Analytics Portfolio

This repository is a curated collection of SQL scripts demonstrating my capability in data exploration, performance measurement, and business-focused analysis.

It includes structured queries covering:

- Data exploration & cleaning  
- KPI measurement & metric creation  
- Change-over-time analysis  
- Time-based trend analysis  
- Customer & behavioral segmentation  
- Funnel and performance diagnostics  

These projects reflect my ability to translate raw data into structured insights that inform business strategy and drive measurable growth.
